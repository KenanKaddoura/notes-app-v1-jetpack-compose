Notes Related to the Project and Clean Architecture Principle:
- The main layers:
1. presentation -> ui
2. data -> everything related to data -> api / db
3. domain -> the connection layer / logic / repo. def.

- As the module is small as it is replaceable and fast to build.
- It is better to build the app according to features and make each feature from the three layers

- Structure:

--> core
--> di
--> feature_name

----> data
------> data_source
------> repository

----> domain
------> model
------> repository
------> use_case
------> util

----> presentation
------> aaa
------> aaa
------> util

- The job of the repository:
 -- It access the data sources (like database or api) directly.
 -- It handles the data sources and which data should be forwarded to the use cases.
